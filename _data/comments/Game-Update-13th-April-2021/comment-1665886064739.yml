  OVI trickets neccesitate all of the specialized tactics employed in criminal
  court rooms.  protecting a OVI begins with deciding not any of a persons
  constitutional rights are trespassed. Because a cop is in direct contact with
  you, and they are essentially the single witness most of the time, their
  training and MO is of the essence.  We all make accidents, and cops are no
  exception.  It begins with reasonable accusation that will progress to
  probable cause. For example, you get pulled over for driving too slow at 4
  a.m..  The cop takes regular suspicion that someone has created a moving
  violation, reckless driving.  Now, as the police officer begins to make visual
  contact or leans in towards the car, he may utter you exhibit red eyes, or
  there is an smell of alcohol. This elevates the reasonable suspicion of
  recklessness to providing the police a clue that someone is driving while
  drunk.  99.9% of cops will say odor of liquor, blood shot ojos, or sloppy
  talk.  They may usually note you were rumaging about getting your id and
  insurance card handy. Now the driver will be likely told to get out of a car
  and start standardized field sobriety checks.  These are SFSTâ€™s are learned
  under NHTSA (National road Traffic precautionary Administration)
  standardizations and need to be instructed per instance.  If you do go through
  the checks, the police officer may make mistakes that can have the test, or
  tests excluded from evidence.  Things such as physical impairments and the
  best field conditions can be integrated into results of your check. (i.e.
  someone can not perform a jump and turn test on ramped pavement). You will
  usually take a digital breath tests.  There are irregularities in these
  devices also, after all they are devices that need maintenance and trained on
  every day.  The arrest is taped from the time the police turns on their
  sirens.  It is through this taped evidence that we are able to secure an
  experienced opinion on the law enforcement giving of the checks, to the
  clients ability taking the checks. If you consent to the checks or not, you
  will go to big house. If you know someone that has been arrested for Driving
  under the inflence or any criminal charges or know some one who  needs a
